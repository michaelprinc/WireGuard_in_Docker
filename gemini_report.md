# Gemini Report: Analysis of the WireGuard & Nginx Project

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the project's current state, focusing on the implementation of the advanced, SSL-enabled configuration.

The project aims to create a dual-mode system: a basic WireGuard+Nginx proxy and an advanced version with automatic SSL certificate management via Let's Encrypt. The foundation for this is solid, utilizing modern containerization practices with Supervisor for process management and a dynamic Nginx configuration system.

However, there are significant inconsistencies between the high-level components (`docker-compose.yml`) and the detailed implementation in scripts and configuration files. The advanced mode, as it stands, is **not runnable**. The primary issues stem from an outdated `docker-compose.yml` that does not support the advanced features, an incorrect Nginx Dockerfile entrypoint, and logical gaps in the configuration management scripts.

This report details these findings and provides concrete recommendations for resolving them to create a robust, functional, and secure solution.

## 2. Process Flow Analysis

### 2.1. Intended Flow (Advanced Mode)

The intended startup sequence for the advanced configuration (`ADVANCED_CONFIGURATION=1`) is as follows:
1.  `docker-compose up` starts the `nginx` and `wireguard` services.
2.  The `nginx` container starts `supervisord`.
3.  `supervisord` launches three key processes:
    *   **`nginx_config_manager.sh`**: A script that runs in a loop, checking for the existence of SSL certificates. Based on the status, it generates the appropriate `nginx.conf` from a template (`initial`, `transition`, or `ssl`).
    *   **`certbot_renewal.sh`**: A script that periodically runs `certbot` to obtain or renew SSL certificates for the domains specified in `.env.website`.
    *   **`nginx`**: The Nginx web server, which serves traffic based on the `nginx.conf` file generated by the config manager.
4.  Initially, no certificates exist. The config manager generates an HTTP-only `nginx.conf` that allows Certbot's HTTP-01 challenge to succeed.
5.  `certbot` runs and successfully obtains certificates.
6.  On its next loop, the `nginx_config_manager.sh` detects the new certificates and generates a new `nginx.conf` with SSL settings and redirects.
7.  The manager reloads Nginx, which now serves traffic over HTTPS.

### 2.2. Current State Analysis & Discrepancies

The intended flow is not achievable with the current file setup due to several critical errors and omissions.

## 3. Identified Issues and Inaccuracies

### 3.1. Critical Issue: `docker-compose.yml` Mismatch

The `docker-compose.yml` file is the most significant point of failure. It has not been updated to support the advanced features.
*   **Incorrect Nginx Service Definition**:
    *   It lacks an `env_file` declaration to load `.env.website`, which is essential for the supervisor and scripts to read the configuration flags (`ADVANCED_CONFIGURATION`, `SSL_ENABLED`, etc.).
    *   The `volumes` mounts are incorrect. It should mount the entire `./config/nginx` directory and `./scripts` directory, not a single `./default.conf` file. It also needs volumes for Certbot (`/etc/letsencrypt`, `/var/www/certbot`).
    *   The `entrypoint` is not defined, so it will use the default from the Dockerfile, which is also incorrect.
    *   It does not expose port 443 for HTTPS traffic.
*   **WireGuard Service**: The `build` context points to `dockerfile: Dockerfile`, but the request was to rename this to `Dockerfile.wireguard`. The entrypoint is the basic one, with no mechanism to switch to an advanced version.

### 3.2. Incorrect Nginx Dockerfile Entrypoint

The `Dockerfile.nginx` is designed to use Supervisor to manage multiple processes (Nginx, Certbot). However, the `ENTRYPOINT` is set to `["/entrypoint.sh"]`, which is a script that does not exist. It should be:
`ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/supervisord", "-c", "/etc/supervisord.conf"]`

### 3.3. Missing `server_blocks/ssl_enabled.conf` File

The `nginx_config_manager.sh` script attempts to read from `server_blocks/ssl_enabled.conf`, but this file was never created. This will cause the script to fail when it tries to generate the SSL-enabled server block.

### 3.4. Supervisor Configuration Issues

The `config/supervisord.conf` uses `autostart=%(ENV_...)s` syntax. This is a valid approach, but it is entirely dependent on the environment variables being available to the `supervisord` process. This requires the `env_file` property in `docker-compose.yml`, which is currently missing.

### 3.5. Script Logic and Race Conditions

*   The `nginx_config_manager.sh` runs a `while true; sleep 30` loop. When the container starts, Nginx might be launched by Supervisor before the manager has run for the first time to create an initial `nginx.conf`. This would cause Nginx to fail. The script should create a default configuration synchronously before entering the loop.
*   The `envsubst` command in the script is brittle as it only lists a few variables. A better approach would be to source the `.env` file and let `envsubst` replace all available environment variables.

## 4. Recommendations for Correction

To make the advanced configuration functional, the following changes are required.

### 4.1. Create Missing Files

Create the `config/nginx/templates/server_blocks/ssl_enabled.conf` file:
```nginx
# This block is included when a certificate is available.
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name ${WEBSITE_DOMAIN};

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/${WEBSITE_DOMAIN}/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/${WEBSITE_DOMAIN}/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/nginx/ssl_params.conf;
    include /etc/nginx/security_headers.conf;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://${SERVICE_ENDPOINT_1};
        include /etc/nginx/proxy_params.conf;
    }
}
```

### 4.2. Correct `Dockerfile.nginx`

Update the `Dockerfile.nginx` to use `supervisord` as the entrypoint.

### 4.3. Correct `nginx_config_manager.sh`

Modify the script to generate a default config before the loop to prevent a race condition.

### 4.4. Correct `docker-compose.yml`

This is the most critical change. A corrected `docker-compose.yml` should be created that defines services for both basic and advanced modes, using YAML anchors to reduce repetition, and includes all necessary volumes, environment files, and port mappings.

### 4.5. Update `Readme.md`

The `Readme.md` should be updated to reflect the corrected, functional setup, with clear instructions for both basic and advanced modes.
