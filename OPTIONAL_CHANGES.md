# Optional Improvements

The repository contains several legacy files and overlapping scripts that are not strictly required to run the basic WireGuard and NGINX setup. The following ideas may improve maintainability but were not implemented:

- Consolidate the multiple NGINX entrypoint scripts into a single version.
- Provide a `supervisord.conf` and fully implement the advanced HTTPS configuration described in `SSL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.
- Refactor the Docker image names to follow a consistent convention across services.
- Remove unused configuration files such as the root `nginx.conf` and `default.conf` duplicates.
- Add automated validation of environment variables during container startup.

These changes are optional and can be addressed later if the project requires more advanced functionality.
